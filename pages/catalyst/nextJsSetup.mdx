# Setting up Catalyst and NextJS

<Steps>

### Initialize Project

Start by initializing a catalyst project with a basic web app client and server using the [Catalyst CLI](https://catalyst.zoho.com/help/cli-init.html).

### Create Next.js App

Once the project is initialized, navigate to the client folder and run the command `npx create-next-app app` to create a Next.js application.

### Add package.json Scripts

After the application is created, open the package.json file located in the app folder. Modify the commands in the scripts key as shown below:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```

### Update next.config.js

Next, navigate to the next.config.js file in the app folder and update it with the following content:

```javascript
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

module.exports = {
  assetPrefix: isProd ? "/app/" : "",
  rewrites: () => {
    return [
      {
        source: "/app/server/:path*",
        destination: "/server/:path*",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

### Update catalyst.json

Once the next.config.js file is updated, open the catalyst.json file in the root of your project folder. Add the following values to the client key:

```json
"scripts": {
  "packageJson": "cd client && cp client-package.json app/out/",
  "build": "cd client/app && npm install && npm run build",
  "preserve": "catalyst run client:build && catalyst run client:packageJson",
  "predeploy": "catalyst run client:build && catalyst run client:packageJson"
}
```

</Steps>
After completing these steps, you should have successfully initialized a client in Next.js.
