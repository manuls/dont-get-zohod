# Zoho Cliq Integration for CRM Alerts

## Description
This script demonstrates how to integrate Zoho Cliq with Zoho CRM to send real-time alerts to a specified Cliq channel when certain events occur in CRM. By leveraging this integration, you can improve collaboration and keep your team informed about important CRM activities directly in Cliq.

```javascript
// Trigger: On After Create (or any relevant trigger)

// Define the details for the Cliq integration
cliqAuthToken = "YOUR_CLIQ_AUTH_TOKEN"; // Update with your Cliq authentication token
cliqChannel = "CHANNEL_NAME"; // Update with the name of your Cliq channel
alertMessage = "A new lead has been created in CRM.";

// Get the record details
leadRecord = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Leads", input.recordId);
leadName = leadRecord.get("First Name") + " " + leadRecord.get("Last Name");

// Prepare the payload for Cliq message
cliqPayload = {"channel": cliqChannel, "text": alertMessage + "\nLead Name: " + leadName};

// Send the Cliq message
response = invokeurl
    [url :"https://cliq.zoho.com/api/v2/channels/message"]
    [headers:{"Authorization":"Bearer " + cliqAuthToken}]
    [type:POST]
    [parameters:cliqPayload];

// Log the response for debugging
info response;
```

## Usage Instructions:

Replace `"YOUR_CLIQ_AUTH_TOKEN"` with your Zoho Cliq authentication token. You can generate an auth token in Cliq by following the instructions in the Zoho Cliq API documentation.  

Update `"CHANNEL_NAME"` with the name of the Cliq channel where you want to send the alerts. 

Customize the alertMessage variable to match your desired notification content.

 1. Modify the **leadRecord.get("First Name") and leadRecord.get("Last
    Name")** fields to match the field names in your Leads module.
        
 2. Save the script and associate it with the relevant trigger, such as
        "On After Create" or any other trigger that suits your alert
        requirements.
        
 3. When a new lead is created, the script will send a message to the
        specified Cliq channel with the alert message and lead details.  

> Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions and authentication
> set up in Cliq to send messages to channels using the API.
