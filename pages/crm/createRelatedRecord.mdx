# Create records related to existing records in Zoho CRM.

When we need to create a related record, such as an Event for a Lead in Zoho CRM (or even a Task or Call), 
it is necessary to follow certain standards that will be described in the comments. 
This specific procedure will be applicable to records related to Leads, Accounts, and Deals.
In this example, a function is executed triggered by a workflow, where the mapping of arguments is defined to identify the specific Lead.

```javascript
//mapping of arguments: leadId = Leads.ID Lead

lead = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Leads",leadId);
startDate = zoho.currenttime.toString("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'-03:00'");;
endDate = startDate.addHour(1).toString("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'-03:00'"); //using Brasilia, Brazil time zone

mp = Map();
mp.put("Event_Title","Alignment meeting");
mp.put("Owner",ifnull(contato.get("Owner"),"").get("id"));
mp.put("What_Id",leadId);
mp.put("$se_module","Leads");
//The $se_module function represents the relationship between modules in these cases.
//For the relationship with the Contacts module, it is not necessary to use the $se_module function. 
//However, it is necessary to change the API from What_Id to Who_Id.
mp.put("Start_DateTime",startDate);
mp.put("End_DateTime",endDate);
mp.put("Event_Status","Scheduled");
mp.put("Type_of_Event","Relationship");
create = zoho.crm.createRecord("Events",mp);
info create;

//When the function is executed, the "info" should provide the key information about the newly created Event record.
```
