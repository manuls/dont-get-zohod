# Adding Contributions through Markdown Files

Contributions are added through .MD or .MDX files. 

Spaces in file names need to have a hyphen. Example: test-one.md

Please be descriptive and don't be afraid to use screenshots.

Copy the template below, this is just a guideline. Feel free to link back to your Github to give yourself credit.

# Heading 1
Define or explain what the function does.

## Sub Heading
Maybe explain the configuration setup or anything else user might need to know. Maybe link to ZOHO Documentation or reference in a link like [here](https://www.zoho.com/us/books/help/).


```javascript
//Display code in here. Please note to label the code as 'javascript' even if its deluge.

myFunction(){
    info "Hello World";
}
```
